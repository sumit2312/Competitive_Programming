We find the longest suffix that is in decreasing order, let its length be k. We swap the preceding 
element x with the smallest one from the decreasing sequence larger than x, and sort the suffix in increasing order.


1.Find the highest index i such that s[i] < s[i+1]. If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.
2.Find the highest index j > i such that s[j] > s[i]. Such a j must exist, since i+1 is such an index.
3.Swap s[i] with s[j].
4.Reverse the order of all of the elements after index i till the last element.
